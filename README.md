# Data Scraping And More With Ruby, Nokogiri and Sinatra!

***

Building a scraper for scraping and parsing data from websites without an available api or RSS feed to access. I will do this by accessing css selectors from the DOM for extracting the data using the Nokogiri tool alongside ruby. I will then take this information and build a sample application, first as a command line tool with ruby and then as a full Sinatra web app.
